# Planar_data_classification_with_one_hidden_layer

Welcome to your week 3 programming assignment! It's time to build your first neural network, which will have one hidden layer. Now, you'll notice a big difference between this model and the one you implemented previously using logistic regression.

By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to:

Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
Compute the cross entropy loss
Implement forward and backward propagation
Important Note on Submission to the AutoGrader
Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:

You have not added any extra print statement(s) in the assignment.
You have not added any extra code cell(s) in the assignment.
You have not changed any of the function parameters.
You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.
You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating extra variables.
If you do any of the following, you will get something like, Grader Error: Grader feedback not found (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made, you can get a fresh copy of the assignment by following these instructions.
